# tensor_puzzle_solutions
This repository contains solutions and detailed explanations for Sasha Rush's [tensor puzzles](https://github.com/srush/Tensor-Puzzles). These puzzles are designed to challenge understanding and intuition about tensor operations and their applications. 

Note that some of the puzzle solutions exceed the character limit. I have purposefully coded longer versions for better understanding (you can reuse functions solved before to resolve this). 

# TODO: 
Add detailed explainations for each of the solutions
